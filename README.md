# Winter Internship - IIT Dharwad

This repository contains all the work done during the Winter Internship at **IIT Dharwad**. Each folder represents a separate machine learning algorithm or model implemented and tested during the internship.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `bayes_classifier/` – Naive Bayes classifier implementation.
- `k_nn/` – K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.
- `k_means/` – K-Means clustering model.
- `gmm/` – Gaussian Mixture Model clustering.
- `ref_template/` – Reference templates or base code used across models.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nitipriya/winter-internship-iit-dharwad.git
cd winter-internship-iit-dharwad
```

### Create folders manually (if cloning early version)

If folders are empty or missing, create them as shown:

```bash
mkdir bayes_classifier k_nn k_means gmm ref_template
```

### Run the models

Each folder will eventually contain:
- Source code (`.ipynb`)
- Results and plots

## 📌 Purpose

This internship project focuses on implementing foundational classification and clustering algorithms from scratch or using minimal libraries to develop a strong understanding of:

- **Probabilistic classifiers**
- **Distance-based models**
- **Unsupervised learning techniques**
- **Evaluation techniques**
